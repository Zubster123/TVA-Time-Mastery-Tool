# TVA-Time-Mastery-Tool
The Time Variance Authority's Time Mastery Tool is a scheduling decision support system built in Excel using VBA. It allows direct .txt imports of your uWaterloo schedule from Quest and visualizes it. The Tool also features a built-in Pomodoro timer for optimal study efficiency and uses the integrated Cohere AI to give you personalized scheduling tips based on your academic program and level of study.

To get started, please read the SETUP file and grab yourself a copy of the User Manual. Many have tried to use the Time Mastery Tool without its Manual, but none have succeeded...
